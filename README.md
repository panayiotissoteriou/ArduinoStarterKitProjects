Project 2: Spaceship interface
A control panel with a switch and lights that turn on when you press the switch. A green LED will be on, until you press a buton. When the Arduino gets
a signal from the buton, the green light will turn of and 2 other lights will start blinking.

Project3: Love-O-Meter
A temperature sensor to measure how warm your skin is. This component outputs a changing voltage depending on the temperature it senses. The sensorâ€™s output is read and used  to turn LEDs on and off, indicating how warm you are. The temperature sensor model, the TMP36, is convenient because it outputs a voltage that changes directly proportionally to the temperature in degrees Celsius.
